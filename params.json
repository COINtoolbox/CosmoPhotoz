The method utilises Generalized Linear Models which reproduce the physical aspects of the output distribution. The rest of the methodology and testing of the technique is described in the associated Astronomy and Computing publication that can be accessed at [link].\r\n\r\nThe software is available on three platforms:\r\n\r\n* R\r\n* R/Shiny (Webapp)\r\n* Python\r\n\r\n.. _pattern: http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern\r\n.. _NLTK: http://nltk.org/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
