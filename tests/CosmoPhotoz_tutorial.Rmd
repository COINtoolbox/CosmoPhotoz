This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



This is an R Markdown document to explain in simple terms the use of Generalized Linear Models into Astronomy reproducing the main results from Ewan et al (2014).


# Required libraries
```{r,results='hide',message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
require(CosmoPhotoz)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
