Description: User-friendly interfaces to perform fast and reliable photometric
    redshift estimation. The code makes use of generalized linear models and
    can adopt gamma or inverse gaussian families, either from a frequentist or
    a Bayesian perspective. The code additionally provides a Shiny application
    providing a simple user interface.
