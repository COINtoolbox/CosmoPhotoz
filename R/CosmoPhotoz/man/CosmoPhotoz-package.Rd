Photometric redshift estimation based on generalized linear models
}
\description{
An user-friendly interfaces to perform fast and reliable photometric 
redshift estimation. The code makes use of generalized linear models and can adopt gamma or 
inverse gaussian families, either from a frequentist or a Bayesian perspective. The code
additionally provides a Shiny application providing a simple user interface.

The CosmoPhotoz package aims to provide an user-friendly interface to enable the estimation
of photometric redshifts. The present version employs generalized linear models and the
user can adopt either gamma or inverse gaussian families from  either a 
frequentist or a Bayesian perspective at the fitting step.

The package includes a plotting function to enable the production of diagnostic plots. Four examples of the implemented visual tests  can be seen in the figures bellow:

\if{latex}{\figure{merged-Diag-Plots.pdf}{options: width=5.3in}}

Additionally, the code is also accompanied by a \pkg{Shiny} application that can be hosted locally or deployed by the user at a webserver. This application allows the user to run the photometric redshift estimation, to configure many parameters of the code visually and experiment with the results. It also allows the user to either use the PHAT0 data, or to upload its own data files (the expected format can be found at the application's help tab). A screenshot of this application can be seen in the next figure.

\if{latex}{\figure{CosmoPhotoz-Shiny.pdf}{options: width=5.3in}}

To run the graphical interface locally, it is sufficient to call: 

\code{runApp(paste(find.package("CosmoPhotoz"),"/glmPhotoZ-2/",sep=""))}
